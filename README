This Util gives you a high level fingerprint of a Oracle DB schema. 

Hopefully people will find this Util useful when comparing Oracle environments, (between dev, test, prod) and when upgrading stacks to make sure environment control is in place and environments are like for like.

It runs the following SQL against the supplied details

"select * from v$version"
"SELECT COUNT(TABLE_NAME) FROM ALL_TABLES"
"select count(column_name) from all_tab_columns"
"select count(index_name) from all_indexes"
"select count(view_name) from all_views"
"select value from nls_database_parameters where parameter='NLS_CHARACTERSET'"

then displays the details on a single line. 

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:-
###############

version.tableCount.columnCount.indexCount.viewCount.characterSet
"Oracle9i Enterprise Edition Release 9.2.0.4.0 - 64bit Production".553.13764.1078.825."WE8ISO8859P15"
