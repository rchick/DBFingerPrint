This Util gives you a high level fingerprint of a Oracle DB schema. 

Hopefully people will find this Util useful when comparing Oracle environments, (between dev, test, prod) and when upgrading stacks to make sure environment control is in place and environments are like for like.

It runs the following SQL against the supplied details

"select * from v$version"
"SELECT COUNT(TABLE_NAME) FROM ALL_TABLES"
"select count(column_name) from all_tab_columns"
"select count(index_name) from all_indexes"
"select count(view_name) from all_views"

then displays the details on a single line.

To run use

Syntax: java -classpath <oracle-driver> -jar DBFingerPrint.jar <JDBC URL> <username> <password>
   <oracle-driver> The full path to the Oracle driver jar file - either classes12.zip or ojdbc14.jar will suffice
   <JDBC URL> db schema full JDBC URL.
   <username> db schema Username.
   <password> db schema Password.
